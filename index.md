## What Am I Up To?

As of October 2022, here are some of the things I am working on/messing with:

* **Ansible** to maintain configuration for services such as BIND and Icinga2
* **Ansible** to bootstrap LXC instances (see [lxc-bootstrap](https://github.com/jonathanmtran/lxc-bootstrap))
* **React**
* **Proxmox** for VMs (currently using ESXi) and LXC containers

## Things (for Me) to Check Out

* Audinate's Dante Certification Program
* VyOS
* WireGuard
