## What Am I Up To?

As of June 2022, here are some of the things I am working on/messing with:

* **Ansible** to maintain configuration for services such as BIND and Icinga2
* Slightly advanced live routing/mixing and multitrack recording with **[Behringer X32](https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=P0AWQ)**
* Web components using **[Lit](https://lit.dev)** (for the day job)
* **Proxmox** for VMs (currently using ESXi) and LXC containers
* TypeScript (driven by the day job)

## Things (for Me) to Check Out

* Audinate's Dante Certification Program
* VyOS
* WireGuard
